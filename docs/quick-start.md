# Quick Start

Welcome to KlongPy! Get up and running with KlongPy in just a few steps.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher (3.11 preferred)
- `pip` for installing packages

## Setup Steps

It's a good idea to work inside a virtual environment so that the
dependencies for KlongPy don't interfere with other Python projects:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

With the environment active, install KlongPy (and optionally `rlwrap`
for a nicer REPL experience):

```bash
pip install "klongpy[full]"
pip install rlwrap  # optional
```


## Setting Up Your First KlongPy Session

After installing KlongPy, you can start using it right away. Hereâ€™s how to set up a basic session:


```bash
$> rlwrap kgpy
Welcome to KlongPy REPL v0.6.0
author: Brian Guarraci
web   : http://klongpy.org
]h for help
ctrl-d or ]q to quit

?> 1+1

?>
```

See the [REPL Reference](repl.md) for more information on commands and operations.
