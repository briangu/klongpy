:"measure process time"

.comment("*****")
time(x)  process time of nilad x in seconds

Note: the resolution of the timer depends on the CLOCKS_PER_SEC
constant, which may be any value between 50Hz and 1MHz.

The time function depends on the .pc() (process clock) system
function, which is not avaliable on Plan 9.
