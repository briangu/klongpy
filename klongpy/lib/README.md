# Library code

These KlongPy modules are available when running in the REPL.

You may override the location of the library files by setting the KLONGPATH environment variable.

## Note

This lib directory is currently under the KlongPy source so that the package manager can include it with the release.  If a better solution can be found, this will be moved into the examples directory.

## Acknowledgement

These example lib files are included from the Klong lib files in the [original Klong distribution](https://t3x.org/klong/index.html).

The plotting libs were removed due to lack of support (so far).

There are some small modifications to deal with Unicode, but otherwise should be the same.
