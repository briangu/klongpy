# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This project values **high-signal contributions**, thoughtful design, and respectful technical discussion.

To keep things focused and maintainable, we use a **discussion-first workflow** rather than open issue submission.

---

## How to Get Involved

### 1. Start with a Discussion

All new ideas, bug reports, and questions should begin as a **GitHub Discussion**.

Use the appropriate category:

* 💡 **Ideas / Proposals** — new features, architecture changes
* 🐞 **Bug Reports** — reproducible issues with clear details
* ❓ **Questions** — usage, behavior, or design clarification
* 🧪 **Experiments** — benchmarks, alternative approaches, research

Well-written discussions often turn into concrete work.

---

### 2. From Discussion → Issue

Issues are **not open for direct submission**.

Maintainers will promote a discussion to an Issue when:

* The problem is clearly defined
* Scope and direction are agreed upon
* The work aligns with project goals

This keeps Issues actionable and prevents backlog drift.

---

### 3. Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome **without a prior issue** if:

* The change is small and obvious (docs, fixes, refactors)
* The intent is clearly explained in the PR description

For anything substantial, **start a discussion first**.

---

## What Makes a Great Contribution

We value:

* Clear problem statements
* Minimal, well-scoped changes
* Reproducible benchmarks or tests
* Thoughtful tradeoff discussion

We especially appreciate contributors who:

* Engage constructively in discussions
* Help refine ideas before coding
* Improve documentation or examples

---

## Becoming a Contributor

Active, constructive participants may be:

* Invited to open Issues directly
* Given triage or review permissions
* Recognized as maintainers over time

Access grows with trust and demonstrated judgment.

---

## Code Standards

* Keep changes focused
* Match existing style and structure
* Include tests or validation where appropriate
* Avoid drive-by refactors unrelated to the change

If in doubt, ask in Discussions first.

---

## Conduct

Be respectful. Assume good intent. Critique ideas, not people.

This project follows a simple rule:

> **Be someone others want to collaborate with.**

Thanks for contributing — we’re glad you’re here.
